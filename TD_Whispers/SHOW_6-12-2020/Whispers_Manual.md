# Transcontinental Whispers
A transcontinental, collaborative Performance

// built for TouchDesigner 42700

Dear Artists,

thank you for participating in this experiment.

There are a few simple rules to follow, so the concept can unfold.

1.) Each Station is responsable for Audio & Video.

2.) Please select your Station Number on each component.

3.) You receive Audio and Video Input via the IN component.

4.) Please Remix Audio and Video, but never block of all of the input. Please let more than 50% of the original signals pass (however that is measured ; )

5.) As we are dealing with a feedback loop, be aware that whatever you do, will come back to a certain degree after approx. 2 minutes (we might still adapt the delay)

6.) This mean that it is advisable to start with very minimal interventions until we all have a feeling for the machine we are playing.

7.) Last but not least: Every Station should make a local recording, so we can document the whole process later (for example in an exhibition with 6 screens)

Just start the recording on the OUT component and save
the TouchScene on a Drive with enough free space.

It would be great if you could upload the recording afterwards to a cloud service of your choice and send me the link.

If you have any questions, please write me at stefan.kraus@mxzehn.de

I am very much looking forward to this!

All the best
Stefan
